| **Data Types**           | Structured, numerical data, text, and dates organized in a relational model | Relational data from transactional systems, operational databases, and applications | Structured and unstructured data from sensors, websites, business apps, mobile apps, etc. | Relational data subsets for specific applications                     | Transactional data from multiple sources                                           |
| **Purpose**              | Transaction processing                                               | Data stored for business intelligence, batch reporting, and data visualization      | Big data analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, and data discovery | Data used by a specific user community for analytics                  | Ingest, integrate, store, and prep data for operations or analytics; often feeds a data warehouse |
| **Data Capture**         | Data captured from a single source, such as a transactional system    | Data captured from multiple relational sources                                      | Data captured from multiple sources that contain various forms of data         | Data typically captured from a data warehouse, but can also be from operational systems and external sources | Data captured from multiple enterprise applications/sources                        |
| **Data Normalization**   | Uses normalized, static schemas                                       | Denormalized schemas; schema-on-write                                               | Denormalized; schema-on-read                                                  | Normalized or denormalized                                           | Denormalized                                                                      |
| **Benefits**             | Provides consistent data for critical business applications           | Historical data from many sources stored in one place; data is classified with user in mind for accessibility | Data in its native format from diverse sources gives data scientists flexibility in analysis and model development | Easy, fast access to relevant data for specific applications and types of users | Fast queries on smaller amounts of real-time or near-real-time data for reporting and operational decisions |
| **Data Quality**         | Data is organized and consistent                                      | Curated data that is centralized and ready for use in BI and analytics               | Raw data that may or may not be curated for use                               | Highly curated data                                                 | Data is cleansed and compliant, but may not be as consistent as in a data warehouse |
