Let's learn about data architecture and its importance in enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions. Here are the key points you covered:

Definition: Modern data architecture is a secure, flexible, and scalable system for ingesting, managing, and analyzing large and diverse datasets.
Key Requirements:
Scalability: Ability to handle growing amounts of data efficiently. (the main point of start ups) 
Flexibility: Adaptability to various data types and sources.
Security: Ensuring data protection and compliance.
Components:
Cloud Computing: Provides scalability and flexibility.
Real-Time Processing: Enables near-instant data consumption and analysis.
Comparison with Traditional Architectures:
Modern architectures leverage cloud technology for flexibility.
They support real-time data processing, unlike traditional systems.
They handle diverse data formats beyond just relational databases.
Here's an example of a modern data architecture definition:

A secure, flexible, and scalable system for ingesting, managing, and analyzing large and diverse datasets.
Understanding these concepts will help you design effective data platforms for modern organizational needs.

In the next lesson, you will learn about designing scalable and efficient data solutions using modern data architectures like Lambda and Kappa.
